Serenus <br/>
Making Mental Health a normal conversation.<br/>

Serenity , Tranquility in Latin translates to Serenus, which is exactly what people need in their day to day hasty life.<br/>
Also given the present quarantine condition one need ot try and keep things sane or it could get pretty rough.<br/>
One in five U.S. residents is impacted by behavioral health issues, e.g., mental illness, alcoholism, substance abuse/drug abuse, bullying, depression, and general anxiety.
One of the major reasons the patients of these issues suffer a lot is due to their inability to express themselves through verbal speech,and <br/>
Hence i created Serenus where one express themselves without using any form of linguistics.
Also one of the leading feature would be the Panic button which directs an emergency call to the Erie Country Crisis Service as well<br/>
gives you the option of notifying your important ones. <br/>
For therapists, Serenus provides a comprehensive email before each session. 
With the provided email, therapists can review their clients weekly Serenus check-ins, identify patterns, and figure out which techniques are best suitable for that specific client.
